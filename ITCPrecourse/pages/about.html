            <p><span class=first-letter>Hi there!</span> My name is Yanay Sova and im starting a new journey in my life, becoming a full-stack
                developer!
            </p>
               <p> <span class=first-letter>Coding</span> is something that's always piqued my interest, the reward of problem-solving and the creative
                approach captured me immediately when I started fiddling with Javascript back in the day, and eventually
                what pushed me to go and learn it in a professional institution.</p>

                <p><span class=first-letter>I'm mostly</span>  self-taught with everything I’ve been doing until today, from import and export coordinator
                to running a website for gaming and working in digital advertising, I experience a lot of career changes
                and now I'm ready for me next one.</p>

                <p><span class=first-letter>For personal interests,</span> I'm first and foremost a musician at heart! From music production to guitar
                playing I’m a studio octopus with many hats I switch more often than not, and I love it! Like coding,
                there is no limit to how much you know, its both exciting and humbling at the same time.<br>

                <span class=first-letter>Other than that,</span> I love traveling and seeing the world, being from a little country like Israel, the
                rest of the world looks even bigger than it is. Whether venturing to a new location or visiting an old
                and familiar one im always glad to hop on a plane and travel, which leads me to the next section of this
                page.
